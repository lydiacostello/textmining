    "The results of the parse_gender function did not surprise me given the thematic material of the texts. Little Women in comparison to Huck Finn has a larger number of female characters and the plot itself is more centered on the relationships between the March sisters, so the 33.212% portion of the text coded as 'female'follows. Huck Finn in comparison has a smaller proportion of female characters and deals with masculine themes, so the 36.356% portion of the text coded as 'male' additionally follows. Finally, Middlemarch is a much more balanced text that features an intersecting cast of both female and male characters, so the large proportion of the (28.951%) being coded as 'unknown' makes sense given the background of the cast."
