    "We've already seen several versions of how to tranform a corpus into a matrix representation. There's code to do it from start to finish in [notebook 04](https://github.com/wilkens-teaching/textmining/blob/master/notebooks/04%20Vectorization.ipynb). Your task in this assignment is to make sure you can perform vectorization using Scikit-learn and to explore the effects of different vectorization options.\n",

    "First, adapt the code toward the end of in-class notebook 04 (link above, see code under the heading \"Sklearn and visualize\") to carry out very basic vectorization of our literary corpus using `TfidfVectorizer` with **default** settings. Visualize your results as demonstrated (without colorization by class). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code in the demo notebook **does not** use the default settings. Modify it so that it does. You'll also need to specify the appropriate imports and file locations, of course. Your output should look like this, assuming you copy over the plotting settings from the demo:\n",
